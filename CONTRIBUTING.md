## Syncing you fork

[Github Help - How to sync a Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)

## Small Corrections

Errata and basic clarifications will be accepted if we agree that they improve the content. You can also open an issue so we can figure out how or if it needs to be addressed.

If you've never done this before, the [flow guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) might be useful.


## How to make a pull request

Please follow the formal procedure to make a Pull Request that is explained in this [Github video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81uKcXZoQ2A)

Take note of what you have to do before doing the Pull Request if the main repository has been updated while you did work on your branch.

## What to do after my pull request is merged

[StackOverflow Question - My Pull Request has been merged, what to do next?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12770550/my-pull-request-has-been-merged-what-to-do-next)

As recommended in the link after you pull request is merged on the main repository.
Go to your fork:

1.  Check out you master branch and [sync it with the main repository](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
2.  Delete the branch you were working with locally and in your remote fork. You shouldn't get any warnings when deleting them since you work is already merged on the master branch in your fork.
